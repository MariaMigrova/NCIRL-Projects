# Project Title: Multiple Linear Regression
## Introduction
Predictive modeling, also known as predictive analysis, involves forecasting future events or outcomes by examining patterns from historical data. The main objective is to predict future results based on past behavior. This approach finds applications in various fields such as weather forecasting, customer behavior analysis, and pricing strategies. The process of predictive modeling involves determining the appropriate model family and fitting the model to the data.

## Regression
Regression is a statistical technique used to determine the strength and nature of the relationship between a dependent variable and a set of independent variables. It finds extensive use in industries like banking and investment.

## Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression models the dependence of a response variable on a single explanatory variable. It assumes a straight-line relationship between the two variables, with the intercept representing the expected mean value of the response variable when the explanatory variable is zero, and the slope indicating the change in the response variable for a unit change in the explanatory variable. The goal is to find the line of best fit that minimizes the squared errors between the observed and predicted values.

## Methodology
### Data Description
The project utilizes a dataset called Credit_v2.csv containing nine variables and 687 observations. These variables include age, education level, years with current employer, years at current address, household income, debt to income ratio, other debt, default status, and credit debt amount. After summarizing the data and examining outliers, we proceed with model building.

### Building the Model
The project aims to predict credit debt using other dependent variables. We compare different linear models for various independent variables and select the model with the highest R-squared value. After trying different combinations of variables, we finalize a model including employment duration, income, debt to income ratio, and other debt. Surprisingly, a model using the " * " operator instead of " + " results in a perfect fit.

### Plotting the Results
We visualize the predicted credit debt using linear models and plot the residuals to assess model performance. The second model, with the " * " operator, exhibits nearly perfect predictions, while the first model shows some deviation.

## Assumptions
Assumption tests reveal issues with linearity, normality, and homoskedasticity in the first model, necessitating transformation of the response variable. The second model meets most assumptions.

## Data Accuracy Metrics
We evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics. Both models perform well, but the second model outperforms the first significantly.
